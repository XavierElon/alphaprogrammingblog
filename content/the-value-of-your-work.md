# Knowing the Value of Your Work

This is not going to be a typical software engineering post about some obscure practice or technicality. Rather it is going to be about something I consider much more important, the value of your work. 

## Value Your Yourself. Know Your Worth

It is beginning of August 2024. The software engineering job market has not been kind to applicants as of lately. This is one of the most important times to understand your worth as a software engineer or you may sell yourself short.

## How to Determine Your Worth

There is no concrete, quantitative way to value your worth as a software engineer. The industry's interview process is quite the obvious indicator of this fact. Even the biggest tech companies have a very hard time determining who is a good engineer and who is not. They even admit to preferring rejecting false negatives over admitting false positives (they would rather reject qualified candidates than hire an unqualified candidate). This obviously leads to less false positives and less obviously more false negatives. This can sort of be though of as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that aim to increase the margin or the distance between the closest data points from each class.

The tech companies are basically trying to make the margin as wide as possible to prevent incorrect classifications, in this case they want the margin as wide as possible to prvent false positives (unqualified candidates).

### Rules for Knowing Your Worth

It is important to know your value when interviewing. If the interviewer's interview process is not good/finetuned you are likely to be misclassified even though you may very well be qualified. Here are some rules and signs to look out for the interview process to avoid wasting your time in the interview proces:

#### 1. **Target Phase**

This is when the event reaches the target element. It’s like the event finally gets to the button and says, “Hey, I’m here!”

### 3. **Bubbling Phase**

After reaching the target, the event bubbles up through the DOM tree back to the root. This is the default behavior and the most commonly used phase. Think of it as the event saying, “Mission accomplished, heading back now.”

When you click the button, you'll see the following output:

### **Stopping Propagation**

Sometimes, you might want to stop an event from propagating further. You can do this using event.stopPropagation().

### **Preventing Default Behavior**
Some elements have default behaviors (like form submission or link navigation). You can prevent these using event.preventDefault().

### **Real World Applications**

Understanding the event lifecycle can help in various real-world scenarios:

	• Form Validation: Capture form submit events to validate data before sending it to the server.
	• Dynamic UI Updates: Manage complex UI interactions by capturing and bubbling events efficiently.
	• Event Delegation: Use capturing and bubbling to handle events on multiple child elements through a single parent.

### **Conclusion**

Understanding the JavaScript event lifecycle is crucial for creating robust and efficient web applications. By mastering event capturing, bubbling, and knowing how to control event propagation, you can create more sophisticated event handling systems and solve complex interaction problems in your web applications.
Remember, while bubbling is more commonly used, there are scenarios where capturing can be incredibly useful. Always choose the approach that best fits your specific use case. 

Hopefully after reading this you no longer ask yourself "WTF is the Javascript Event Lifecycle" :)
